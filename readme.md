* The purpose of this smart contract is to allow the owner to create and send a love letter to someone which is cryptographically private.

* Smart contract is called "LoveLetterToWhoever" and is built using the Solidity programming language and OpenZeppelin libraries.

* Contract implements access control using the "Ownable" library from OpenZeppelin, which ensures that only the owner of the contract can perform certain actions such as setting the message and the PIN.

* Message is encrypted using the Sha256 library from OpenZeppelin, making it difficult for anyone but the intended recipient to read.

* Contract owner sets the PIN, which is required to open the love letter.

* Contract owner is intended to give someone they have a crush on the PIN, so they can read the message at a later time, rather than force them to guess it.

* Alternatively, the contract owner could use a "message in a bottle" approach wherein anyone who finds the PIN receives the love letter as a reward, and the PIN remains secret.

* To open the love letter, the recipient must provide the correct PIN, which is checked by the smart contract. If the correct PIN is entered, the smart contract returns the decrypted message.
